/**
 * A suite of lazy functions, often higher order, across {@code Iterable} instances.
 *
 * <p>Each function defined in this class is lazy, i.e., it does not iterate over the
 * supplied {@code Iterable} instance(s) itself but instead prepares a return value
 * that will yield semantically correct results with respect to the function's definition
 * when the return value or one of its components is iterated. This has a number of benefits:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Iteration/realisation of the underlying {@code Iterable} instance(s) are only
 * performed when required and only as far through the {@code Iterable} as required.</li>
 * <li>Infinite {@code Iterable} instances can be manipulated while consuming a
 * finite amount of memory.</li>
 * <li>Lazy function evaluations can easily be composed into complex calculations
 * whilst keeping the number of required iterations of the underlying {@code Iterable}
 * instance(s) to a minimum.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Because of this it is generally recommended to use functions from {@code Lazily} over
 * those in {@code Eagerly} and then to materialize the resulting {@code Iterable}
 * instance(s) into whatever concrete {@code Iterable} type is required as the last step
 * in evaluation.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>As an example consider the following:
 * <blockquote>
 * <pre>
 *      Iterable&lt;BigInteger&gt; naturalNumbers = naturalNumbers.getAll();
 *      Iterable&lt;BigDecimal&gt; doubledNaturals = Lazily.map(naturalNumbers, new Mapper&lt;BigInteger, BigDecimal&gt;() {
 *        &#64;Override public BigDecimal map(BigInteger number) {
 *          return new BigDecimal(number.multiply(new BigInteger("2")));
 *        }
 *      });
 *      Iterable&lt;Pair&lt;Integer, BigDecimal&gt;&gt; enumeratedDoubledNaturals = Lazily.enumerate(doubledNaturals);
 *      Iterable&lt;Pair&lt;Integer, BigDecimal&gt;&gt; firstHundredEnumeratedDoubledNaturals = Lazily.take(enumeratedDoubledNaturals, 100);
 *      Map&lt;Integer, BigDecimal&gt; firstHundredDoubledNaturals = Literals.mapFromPairs(firstHundredEnumeratedDoubledNaturals);
 * </pre>
 * </blockquote>
 * Here a number of lazy operations are performed and then the final {@code Iterable} is
 * materialised into a {@code Map} instance. The original {@code Iterable} is an
 * infinite sequence of elements however this series of operations will only iterate and
 * map over the first hundred elements.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>This example has been written in full but of course, via static imports and method extraction, it can
 * be made more concise as shown in the following:
 * <blockquote>
 * <pre>
 *      Map&lt;Integer, BigDecimal&gt; firstHundredDoubledNaturals = mapFromPairs(take(enumerate(map(naturalNumbers.getAll(), toDoubledBigDecimals())), 100);
 * </pre>
 * </blockquote>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>Note that none of the values returned by these functions memoise their contents
 * upon iteration. Thus, if the input {@code Iterable} instance(s) have expensive side
 * effects on iteration such as loading from the file system or a database or performing
 * expensive computations, the laziness of these functions will mean this cost will
 * be incurred on every iteration. Instead consider materialising either the input
 * or output values prior to repeated iteration.</p>

     *     Iterable&lt;Customer&gt; customers = customerStore.getAll();
     *     Iterable&lt;Pair&lt;Integer, Customer&gt; enumeratedCustomers = enumerate(customers);
     *     Iterable&lt;Pair&lt;Integer, Customer&gt; prizeWinningEnumeratedCustomers = filter(customers, new Predicate&lt;Pair&lt;Integer, Customer&gt;&gt;() {
     *         public boolean evaluate(Pair&lt;Integer, Customer&gt; enumeratedCustomer) {
     *             return (enumeratedCustomer.getFirst() + 1) % 1000 == 0;
     *         }
     *     }
     *     Iterable&lt;Customer&gt; prizedCustomers = map(prizeWinningEnumeratedCustomers, new Mapper&lt;Pair&lt;Integer, Customer&gt;, Customer&gt;() {
     *         public Customer map(Pair&lt;Integer, Customer&gt; prizeWinningEnumeratedCustomer) {

     *         }
     *     }
     * </pre>

     * Lazily takes the cartesian product of the elements from all {@code Iterable}
     * instances in the supplied {@code Iterable} instance generating an {@code Iterable}
     * of {@code Iterable}s with each having as many elements as there were
     * {@code Iterable} instances in the input {@code Iterable}. The returned
     * {@code Iterable} will contain {@code Iterable} instances where the first position
     * is occupied by an element from the first {@code Iterable} in the supplied
     * {@code Iterable}, the second position is occupied by an element from the second
     * {@code Iterable} in the input {@code Iterable} and so on for each available
     * {@code Iterable}. The {@code Iterable} will effectively contain an {@code Iterable}
     * for each possible selection of elements for the positions from each of the
     * corresponding {@code Iterable} instances in the supplied {@code Iterable}. It is
     * understood that there are an absurd number of references to {@code Iterable} in
     * this definition, hopefully the example usage will be more descriptive.
     *
     * <p>For a more mathematical description of the cartesian product, see the
     * <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product">
     * cartesian product article on Wikipedia</a>.</p>
     *
     * <p>Since a lazy {@code Iterable} is returned, the cartesian product is taken
     * lazily, i.e., none of the supplied {@code Iterable} instances
     * is iterated until elements are yielded from the returned
     * {@code Iterable}.</p>
     *
     * <p>If any of the supplied {@code Iterable} instances is empty, the
     * returned {@code Iterable} is effectively empty. If any of the supplied
     * {@code Iterable} instances are infinite, then the returned
     * {@code Iterable} will also be infinite. Be aware that in the case of
     * an infinite {@code Iterable}, the current algorithm will lead to
     * minimal variability in the returned {@code Iterable} instances, i.e.,
     * there is a possibility only one position of the returned {@code Iterable}
     * instances will ever change.</p>
     *
     * <p>Note that this overload of {@code cartesianProduct} does not preserve type
     * information and so the returned {@code Iterable} will contain {@code Iterable}
     * instances over the wildcard type {@code ?}. If the number of {@code Iterable}
     * instances for which a cartesian product is required is less than ten,
     * use the explicit arities of {@code cartesianProduct}.</p>
     *
     * <h4>Example Usage:</h4>
     * Given three {@code Iterable} instances of varying types:
     * <blockquote>
     * <pre>
     *     Iterable&lt;Integer&gt; first = iterableWith(1, 2);
     *     Iterable&lt;String&gt; second = iterableWith("first", "second", "third");
     *     Iterable&lt;Boolean&gt; third = iterableWith(false);
     * </pre>
     * </blockquote>
     * we can generate the cartesian product as follows:
     * <blockquote>
     * <pre>
     *     Iterable&ltIterable&lt?&gt;&gt; iterables = Literals.&lt;Iterable&lt?&gt;&gt;iterableWith(first, second, third);
     *     Iterable&lt? extends Iterable&lt;?&gt;&gt; cartesianProduct = cartesianProduct(iterables);
     * </pre>
     * </blockquote>
     * This is effectively equivalent to the following:
     * <blockquote>
     * <pre>
     *     Iterable&lt;? extends Iterable&lt;?&gt;&gt; equivalentIterables = Literals.&ltIterable&lt?&gt;&gt;iterableWith(

     * </pre>
     * </blockquote>
     * we can zip them into an {@code Iterable} of {@code Iterable} instances as follows:
